        <h2>Brazilian Culture and Traditions</h2>
        <p>Brazil has a rich and exciting cultural heritage that is full of music, dance, and celebrations. One of the most famous traditions in Brazil is Carnival, a huge festival that happens every year before Lent, usually in February or March. During Carnival, people in Brazil celebrate with lively parades, colorful costumes, and dancing in the streets. Samba, a type of music and dance that originated in Brazil, is one of the most popular forms of dance during Carnival. The streets fill with the sounds of samba music, and dancers wear bright, sparkling costumes that show off Brazil's love for fun and creativity.

		<hr>
		<p>Beyond Carnival, Brazil has many other traditions and cultural practices, from delicious foods like feijoada (a stew made with beans and pork) to capoeira (a dance-like martial art). The country's culture is also shaped by its indigenous people, African heritage, and European influences, creating a unique and diverse way of life that is celebrated throughout the year.
		Brazil's festivals, music, dance, and food all show how much the country values joy, community, and togetherness.
